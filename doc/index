This document describes the purpose of the different doc/* files.

authors:
    Lists the authors of Minigrace code
build:
    Provides instructions for compiling Minigrace.
errata:
    Describes the differences between Minigrace's implementation and the
    specified Grace language, including both specified features that are
    not implemented, or that are partly implemented, and extensions
    supported by Minigrace that are not standardised. Also enumerates
    various environment variables and options that may be used to
    control the compiler's behaviour.
exceptions:
    Documents the design and implementation of exceptions and exception
    handlers in Minigrace.
generics:
    Describes the behaviour of generic parameters.
gpl3:
    The text of the licence Minigrace is distributed under.
hacking:
    Provides guidelines for submitting modifications to Minigrace.
index:
    This file.
interop:
    Provides hints for how to write glue code for interoperability
    between Grace code and other systems for use with Minigrace.
modules:
    Describes the locations imported modules are found, and documents
    the modules included in the Minigrace distribution that might be
    useful in user code.
unicode:
    Defines the behaviour of Minigrace with regard to Unicode, including
    how strings behave and are defined, which characters are valid in
    identifiers and numbers, and source file encoding.
usage:
    Describes options and modes to the compiler and how the compiler is
    expected to behave.

General information is found in the README file in the root of the
repository.

A compiler for the Grace language.

Minigrace compiles Grace to C and JavaScript. The compiler is written in
Grace itself. It supports most of the specified language to date: for
details on current language feature support see <doc/errata>.

Minigrace should work on POSIX-compliant systems, and is known to work
on Linux, NetBSD, and Mac OS X. It requires a properly-configured GCC on
the path, which may require installing development tools.

Tarball distributions should compile with just `./configure && make`.

The Git repository is able to bootstrap itself with `make` on some
systems, but it is recommended first to bootstrap from a tarball by
running `tools/tarball-bootstrap -a`. More detailed build instructions
are in <doc/build>.

After building there will be a `minigrace` executable in the root. This
executable supports a few different modes and options, described in
<doc/usage>. The simplest usage is just:
  ./minigrace file.grace
which will compile file.grace to an executable and then run it.

The Minigrace documentation is listed in the <doc/index> file.
